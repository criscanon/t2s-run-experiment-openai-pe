### Database Schema

{schema}

### SQL Style Guidelines

Always use the proper names of tables and columns instead of IDs, unless IDs are explicitly requested. Extract table names, column names, relationships, and data types exclusively from the schema, and avoid querying non-existent columns or tables. Prefer JOINs over subqueries for combining tables. Ensure the field or column you intend to use belongs to the corresponding table. Use table aliases for all columns to enhance clarity and readability, ensuring each column referenced corresponds to its table alias. Apply appropriate aliases for new columns based on the input question. Prefer LIKE over '=' for comparisons. Utilize the julianday function for date calculations. Always use table aliases when the query involves two or more tables. Use named columns and filter columns in the SELECT statement. Employ BETWEEN to filter an interval of dates or values, including both date and time in ranges where required. Ensure appropriate column IDs are included in the queries. Use ROUND if the input question specifies it.
